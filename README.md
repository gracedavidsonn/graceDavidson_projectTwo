# Project 2: Words in Motion

by Grace Davidson

# Overview

When I think of what community means to me, I think of my family, close friends, and my boyfriend. Many of my memories of my community that I cherish are linked to music so to represent that, I have animated lyrics from <a href="https://youtu.be/rblt2EtFfC4?feature=shared">Prince's song "1999."</a> The song is reminiscent of the many nights that turned into 80s dance parties with my family throughout my childhoood. I also chose this song as an homage to my dad, one of the biggest Prince fans ever.
