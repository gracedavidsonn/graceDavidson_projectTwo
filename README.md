# Project 2: Words in Motion

by Grace Davidson

# Overview

When I think of what community means to me, I think of my family, close friends, and my boyfriend. Many of my memories of my community that I cherish are linked to music so to represent those community memories, I have animated lyrics from <a href="https://youtu.be/rblt2EtFfC4?feature=shared">Prince's song "1999."</a> The song is reminiscent of the many nights that turned into 80s dance parties with my family throughout my childhoood. I also chose this song as an homage to my dad, one of the biggest Prince fans ever. The excerpt of the lyrics I included spoke the most to me visually and made me excited to experiment with color, expressive fonts, and animation. Plus I made sure to incorporate Prince's signature purple through out the design of the webpages.

# Technical Overview

I decided to design the lyrics by splitting them across ten pages. Dynamic words in the lyrics are emphasized through color and movement. To navigate through the song lyrics, users  click on the emphasized word(s) on each page. On pages with more than one emphasized line of text, I originally only linked what I thought was the most important part of the lyric but I later changed my mind and linked both emphasized parts so that the user can follow the lyrics as they speak to them.
